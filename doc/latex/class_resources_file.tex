\subsection{Detailed Description}
Resources is a file which specifies all internal assets. Assets can be any file used in a Topaz project, like textures or 3D models. Internal assets are instantiated upon initialisation of Topaz, and are available for use at any time. External assets are files which are not specified in Resources and thus are not tracked or handled by Topaz; you must handle them yourself. Although external assets can be used for all actions, internal assets are recommended. Resources are normally defined either inline in Properties or externally by the filename \textquotesingle{}resources.\+mdl\textquotesingle{}. The path to the Resources should always be specified in Properties.
