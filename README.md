Ocular Engine -- C/C++ Graphics Engine using SDL via dynamic link-library and OpenGL via the GL Extension Wrangler (GLEW), via source inclusion.
Aswell as the source code, this repository contains all the data files used during the development and testing process of the project, including but not limited to:
- Wavefront OBJ Models (No copyright infringement intended, request and it shall be removed).
- Image Textures (No copyright infringement intended, request and it shall be removed).
- Custom Data Files (No formal name for the format being used, but it's a more primitive version of MDL. In other words, a very primitive version of YAML).

Development on this project is incredibly slow due to being the sole developer of a humongous undertaking. I don't expect to finish this within the decade; my original intentions for this project would be to serve as my life's work.
