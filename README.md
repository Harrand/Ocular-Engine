# Topaz 2
## About

Topaz 2 is a rewrite of the [Topaz](https://github.com/Harrand/Topaz) engine. Topaz 2 is an open-source cross-platform graphics/game engine written in C++17.

The Topaz Project has been ongoing since it began as a school project in 2015.

##### Note: Topaz 2 is new and is not yet ready for use. Consider using the legacy Topaz engine. Despite all its flaws, it is usable.

### Built With

* [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) - Open Source, multi-language Vulkan/GL/GLES/EGL/GLX/WGL loader-generator based on the official specs. Used to load OpenGL procedures at runtime for use by the engine.
* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) - Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan development on the desktop. Used as a cross-platform abstraction for input event processing and windowing.
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - Open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. Used to generate build system files so users can build topaz with the build system of their choice.
